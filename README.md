## My process

### Built with

Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS3 custom properties

- Flexbox for layout

- Mobile-first design approach

### What I learned

During this project, I practiced using Flexbox for centering content efficiently. Additionally, I improved my understanding of hover and focus states to enhance accessibility and user experience.

Hereâ€™s an example of the hover effect I implemented:

```.social-links ul li a:hover {
    background-color: hsl(75, 94%, 57%);
    transition: background-color 0.3s ease-in-out;
}
```

This ensures a smooth transition effect when a user hovers over the social links

### Continued development

Moving forward, I plan to:

- Explore CSS Grid for layout alternatives.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - CSS Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_transitions/Using_CSS_transitions) - Helped me understand how to center elements properly.
- [CSS Tricks - Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
